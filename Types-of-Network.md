# Types of Networks

# **Types of Computer Networks**

### 1. **Personal Area Network (PAN)**
   - **Range**: 1 to 100 meters.
   - **Speed**: Very high.
   - **Technologies**: Bluetooth, Zigbee, IrDA.
   - **Example**: USB devices, smartphones, tablets, and printers.
   - **Use**: Communication between devices in a single person's workspace.

### 2. **Local Area Network (LAN)**
   - **Range**: Up to 2 km.
   - **Speed**: Very high.
   - **Technologies**: Ethernet, Wi-Fi.
   - **Example**: Networks in homes, offices, schools.
   - **Use**: Connects computers within a limited geographical area.

### 3. **Campus Area Network (CAN)**
   - **Range**: 1 km to 5 km.
   - **Speed**: Very high.
   - **Technologies**: Ethernet.
   - **Example**: Networks in schools, college campuses, office buildings.
   - **Use**: Covers several buildings within a campus area.

### 4. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**
   - **Range**: 5 km to 50 km.
   - **Speed**: Average.
   - **Technologies**: FDDI, ATM, CDDI.
   - **Example**: Networking in a city, town, or large urban area.
   - **Use**: Connects computers over a metropolitan area.

### 5. **Wide Area Network (WAN)**
   - **Range**: Above 50 km.
   - **Speed**: Very low.
   - **Technologies**: Leased-line, Dial-up.
   - **Example**: The Internet.
   - **Use**: Connects networks over large geographical distances.
