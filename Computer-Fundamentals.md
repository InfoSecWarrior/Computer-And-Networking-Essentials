# Introduction to Computers

Computer is an electronic device that accepts input, processes it, and produces output under the control of the user.



## Components of a Computer

### Hardware

**Hardware** refers to the **physical components** of a computer system — the parts that can be physically touched.

**Examples:**

* Central Processing Unit (CPU)
* Monitor
* Keyboard
* Mouse

### Software

**Software** consists of the **logical, non-tangible components** — the programs and data that run on the hardware.

**Examples:**

* Operating Systems (e.g., Windows, Linux)
* Applications (e.g., VLC Media Player, MS Paint)
* System tools and utilities



## Types of Software

### 1. System Software

Responsible for managing system hardware and core functions.

**Examples:**

* Operating Systems (OS)
* BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)

### 2. Application Software

Designed to help users perform specific tasks.

**Examples:**

* VLC Media Player
* Microsoft Paint
* Word Processors

### 3. Utility Software

Provides tools for system maintenance, performance optimization, and security.

**Examples:**

* Antivirus software
* Firewalls
* Disk cleanup tools



## Input Devices

Input devices are used to provide data and control signals to a computer system.

**Common input devices:**

* Keyboard
* Mouse
* Microphone
* Thumb scanner



## Operating System (OS)

An **Operating System** is a collection of programs that serves as an interface between the user and the computer hardware. It facilitates the coordination and management of hardware and software resources.

### OS Interaction Models

* **Windows Workflow:**
  User → Application → Operating System → Hardware

* **Linux Workflow:**
  User → Shell → Kernel → Hardware



### Functions of an Operating System

**1. Process Management**

* Manages the execution of programs
* Includes task scheduling, multitasking, and termination of processes

**2. Memory Management**

* Allocates and deallocates system memory
* Ensures optimal and safe use of RAM

**3. Input/Output (I/O) Management**

* Manages communication between the system and external devices
* Handles operations with peripherals like keyboards, screens, and printers



## Internet and Intranet

### Internet

The **Internet** is a global network that connects millions of computers and devices worldwide. It enables access to vast information, online communication, and various services.

### Intranet

An **Intranet** is a private network used within an organization to securely share company information and computing resources among employees. It is not accessible to the general public.
