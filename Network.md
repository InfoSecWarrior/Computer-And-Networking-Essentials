## **Introduction to Networks**

A **network** is a group of two or more devices connected together to share resources and exchange information. These devices can include computers, servers, printers, routers, and other hardware components. Networks may be connected via **wired** (e.g., Ethernet) or **wireless** (e.g., Wi-Fi) methods.



### **Types of Network Models**

- **Client-Server Networks**

   In this model, **centralized servers** provide services and resources (like file storage, email, and databases) to **client devices** such as computers and smartphones. Clients request data or services, and the server responds. This architecture is commonly used in **businesses and organizations**.

- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks**

   In a P2P network, **each device is equal** and can act as both a client and a server. Devices communicate directly with each other to share files or resources. This setup is typically used in **home networks and small businesses** for file sharing and collaborative tasks.



## **Types of Networks**

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**

   A LAN connects devices within a **limited geographical area** such as a home, office, or school. It uses **switches** to interconnect devices and may employ either wired or wireless connections. LANs are ideal for sharing printers, files, and other local resources.

- **CAN (Campus Area Network)**

   A CAN spans a **larger area than a LAN**, typically covering **university or corporate campuses**. It links multiple buildings or departments and often uses **fiber optics** and **Layer 3 (L3) switches** to ensure high-speed connectivity.

- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**

   A MAN covers an area the size of a **city or metropolitan region**. It connects multiple LANs, usually using **routers**, and is used by institutions like **universities or large companies** that need to span multiple locations in the same city.

- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**

   A WAN spans a **large geographical area**, often connecting networks across **cities, countries, or continents**. WANs are used for long-distance communication and data transfer between **branch offices or data centers**, utilizing **leased lines, satellite links, or VPNs** and **routers** for connectivity.


## **Network Topology**

**Network topology** refers to the **physical or logical arrangement** of devices in a computer network. It defines how different nodes (such as computers, switches, and routers) are connected and how **data flows** between them.


### **Common Types of Network Topologies**

#### **Bus Topology**

* All devices are connected to a **single central cable**, known as the **backbone**.
* Data travels in **both directions** along the cable.
* **Advantages**: Simple and cost-effective for small networks.
* **Disadvantages**: A failure in the backbone can bring down the entire network.

#### **Star Topology**

* All devices are connected to a **central hub or switch**.
* Communication between devices passes **through the central device**.
* **Advantages**: Easy to manage and troubleshoot; failure of one device doesnâ€™t affect others.
* **Disadvantages**: If the hub/switch fails, the entire network goes down.

#### **Ring Topology**

* Devices are connected in a **circular loop**.
* Data travels in **one direction** around the ring.
* **Advantages**: Predictable data flow.
* **Disadvantages**: A break in the ring can disrupt communication entirely.

#### **Mesh Topology**

* Every device is connected to **every other device** in the network.
* Data can travel through **multiple paths**.
* **Advantages**: High reliability and fault tolerance.
* **Disadvantages**: Expensive and complex to set up and maintain.

#### **Hybrid Topology**

* A combination of **two or more topologies** (e.g., **star-bus** or **star-ring**).
* Used to meet specific organizational needs.
* **Advantages**: Flexible and scalable.
* **Disadvantages**: Can be complex to design and manage.
